# Readable API Server

This is the starter project of Udacity's Redux. Users will be able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users will also be able to edit and delete posts and comments.

## Installation instructions

These instructions will help you install the app on your local machine.

#### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Git and Node installed, before you proceed.

#### 1. Clone the repositors to your local machine

To clone and run this application, you will need Git installed on your computer.

#### 2. Run "npm install" in your local repository's folder

To get started developing right away:
